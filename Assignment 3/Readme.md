## ðŸ§  Abstract

This project presents a novel framework for option pricing by integrating the **binomial tree model** with **game theory**, specifically **Nash Equilibrium**. Using historical stock and option data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) fetched via the `yfinance` API, we simulate asset prices through a multi-step binomial tree.  
At each terminal node, a **payoff matrix** is constructed and interpreted as a strategic game between the option buyer and seller. By formulating this as a **linear programming** problem, we compute Nash equilibrium strategies.  
The method is **backtested** using historical data to evaluate profitability and robustness across market conditions.
